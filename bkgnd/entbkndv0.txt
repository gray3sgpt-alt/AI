AI Overview
To install
Qwen Code on Ubuntu, you can use npm (Node Package Manager) or install it from source. The npm method is generally recommended for ease of use. 
Prerequisites
Before installation, ensure you have Node.js version 20 or higher installed on your Ubuntu system. 
You can check your current Node.js version by running:
bash

node -v

If you need to install or update Node.js, you can use the following command to install the latest version via the Node Version Manager (nvm): 
bash

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com | bash
# Close and reopen your terminal, then install Node.js 20+
nvm install node

Installation Steps
Choose one of the following methods:
Method 1: Install using NPM (Recommended) 
This command globally installs the Qwen Code CLI tool, making the qwen command available from any terminal location. 
bash

npm install -g @qwen-code/qwen-code@latest

Method 2: Install from Source
If you prefer to install from the GitHub repository, follow these steps: 

    Clone the repository:
    bash

    git clone https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code.git
    cd qwen-code

    Install dependencies:
    bash

    npm install
    npm install -g .

     

Verification and Configuration

    Verify the installation by checking the version:
    bash

    qwen --version

    This should display the installed version of Qwen Code.
    Start Qwen Code in interactive mode:
    bash

    qwen

    Authenticate: On the first run, you will be prompted to sign in using Qwen OAuth or an OpenAI-compatible API key.
        For Qwen OAuth, type /auth within the Qwen Code prompt and follow the browser authentication flow.
        Alternatively, set environment variables in your terminal before running qwen:
        bash

        export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
        # Optional: For Qwen-specific models, use their base URL and model name
        export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"
        export OPENAI_MODEL="qwen3-coder-plus"

         

You can now start using Qwen Code to generate and refactor code, generate unit tests, and perform other coding tasks directly from your terminal.
