# ChatGPT Knowledge Vault

This folder is a long-term, AI-assisted knowledge base for:
- Projects (active + archived)
- Repeatable prompt patterns
- Command snippets and workflows
- Decisions, assumptions, and rationale
- Sources and references
- Security / threat notes
- Experiments and model notes

## How to use
- Start every new effort in `projects/<project>/`
- Capture decisions in `decisions/`
- Save reusable prompts in `prompts/`
- Log sessions in `logs/`
- When done, move project to `archives/` and link it from `ARCHIVED_PROJECTS.md`

## Conventions
- Dates: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Filenames: `kebab-case.md`
- “Session log” entries should be short and searchable.
